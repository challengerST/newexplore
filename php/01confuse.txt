the difference of singal and double quotation marks;
dot and comma difference;
echo '1+5=' . 1;
the point is the first to be stitched without calculation;
why is it a comma?
1. echo ('1+5' . 5)+1; //2
we give the front of the brackets after the results are the same.Prove that PHP is the fisrt to connect the string and then add the 
calculation.according to the direction from left to right.
so good .since it is the first to connect to the string.so it should be "1+55".then use this string plus 1.why is it 2;
this is related to the fact that the string in Php becomes a number.Let's look at the following example;
1. echo (int)'abc1'; //0
2. echo (int)'1abc'; //1
3. echo (int)'2abc'; //2
4. echo (int)'22abc'; //22
From the above example we can see that if a string is cast to a number,PHP will serach for the begining of the string,if the
begining is a number to convert.if not directly return to 0;back to just 1+55,so after the mandatory type conversion should be 1.
On this basis,plus 1.of course 2;
in order to prove our guess,let us vertify it;
1. echo '5+1=' . 1+5; //10
2. echo '5+1=' . 5+1; //6
3. echo '1+5=' . 1+5; //6
4. echo '1+5=' . 5+1; //2
Our proof is correct
$cars=array("Volvo","BMW","SAAB");
at is an meaning of the reference;
echo and print the difference:
print $a,$b;throwing an error;(because it can only output an string);
int is an integer;
class_object is my pain points;
get_object_vars£º
a class can contain its own varaibles,contants,and functions;
when to use var_dump and when to use echo;
the space is also the length of the character inside;
